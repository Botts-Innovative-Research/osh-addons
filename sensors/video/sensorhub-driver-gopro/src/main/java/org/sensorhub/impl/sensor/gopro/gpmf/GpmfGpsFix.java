/**
 * One GPS fix decoded from a GPMF payload.
 * <p>
 * The altitude is whatever the camera reported, without any datum conversion. Cameras through the HERO7
 * report height above the WGS84 ellipsoid, while the HERO8 and newer report mean sea level, so the caller
 * has to say which datum applies to the camera it is reading.
 *
 * @param latitude       Latitude in degrees.
 * @param longitude      Longitude in degrees.
 * @param altitude       Altitude in metres, on the camera's own datum.
 * @param speed2D        Ground speed in metres per second, or NaN if the camera did not report one.
 * @param speed3D        Speed through the air in metres per second, or NaN if the camera did not report one.
 * @param fixType        GPS fix quality: 0 for no fix, 2 for a 2D fix, 3 for a 3D fix, or -1 if unreported.
 * @param dop            Dilution of precision, or NaN if the camera did not report one.
 * @param utcTime        Time of the fix in seconds since the epoch, or NaN if the camera did not report one.
 * @param altitudeSystem The four-character altitude system the camera declared, {@code MSLV} for mean sea
 *                       level or {@code GEOD} for the ellipsoid, or null if it declared none.
