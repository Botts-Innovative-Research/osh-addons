/**
 * Reads the key-length-value tree out of a GPMF payload.
 * <p>
 * A GPMF entry is an 8-byte header followed by its payload, padded out to a 32-bit boundary:
 * <pre>
 *   bytes 0-3  four-character key, for example ACCL
 *   byte  4    sample type code, see {@link GpmfType}
 *   byte  5    size in bytes of one sample
 *   bytes 6-7  number of samples (big-endian)
 *   bytes 8..  payload, of (sample size * sample count) bytes, then padded to a multiple of four
 * </pre>
 * Entries of the nested type hold a sequence of further entries as their payload, which is how a payload
 * describes its devices ({@code DEVC}) and their sensor streams ({@code STRM}).
 * <p>
 * This class only builds the tree. Turning it into telemetry, which means pairing each sensor stream with
 * its name, units, and scale divisors, is {@link GpmfPayload}'s job.
