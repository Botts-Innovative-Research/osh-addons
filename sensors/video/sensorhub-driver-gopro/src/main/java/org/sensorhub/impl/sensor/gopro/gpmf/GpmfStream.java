 * One sensor stream decoded out of a GPMF payload, with its scale divisors already applied.
 * <p>
 * A stream is a run of samples of one quantity, for example the accelerometer readings recorded over the
 * payload's time interval. Samples carry {@link GpmfStream#getElementCount()} values each, so a
 * three-axis accelerometer with 200 samples reports an element count of 3 and 600 values.

 * Streams whose samples are text rather than numbers, such as the GPS UTC timestamp, report zero values
 * and carry their content in {@link GpmfStream#getText()} instead.
